Iris Flower Classification
This project is a simple machine learning classification task that uses the famous Iris flower dataset to classify flowers into three species: Setosa, Versicolor, and Virginica.

 Project Overview
The Iris dataset contains 150 samples of iris flowers, each with four features:

Sepal length

Sepal width

Petal length

Petal width

Objective:
To train a machine learning model that accurately predicts the species of an iris flower based on its measurements.

 Tools & Technologies
Python

Jupyter Notebook

Libraries:

pandas, numpy for data manipulation

matplotlib, seaborn for visualization

scikit-learn for model training and evaluation

 Machine Learning Models Used
Logistic Regression

K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)

Support Vector Machine (SVM)

Decision Tree

Random Forest

Models are trained and evaluated based on accuracy and classification reports.
 Visualizations
The project includes:

Pair plots and correlation heatmaps for feature analysis.

Confusion matrices to assess prediction performance.

 Results
Multiple models were tested and compared. The model(s) with the best performance are highlighted with accuracy scores.
